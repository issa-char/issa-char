# Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full Stack Developer and Penetration Tester with a passion for coding and a knack for problem-solving. I spend most of my time on my keyboard, crafting solutions and exploring the digital world.

## About Me

I'm proficient in a variety of programming languages and their respective frameworks including:

- **JavaScript (JS)**: Node.js, Bun, Express.js, React.js
- **Python**: Django, Flask
- **Ruby**: Ruby on Rails
- **C/C++**: Boost, Qt
- **Lua**

I'm a Linux user, which empowers me with a great deal of flexibility and control over my development environment.

## What I Do

As a **Full Stack Developer**, I handle all aspects of developing an application, including front-end, back-end, database, networking, and user interface design.

As a **Penetration Tester**, I help identify and fix security vulnerabilities in systems. I use my skills to simulate cyber attacks on a system to check for exploitable vulnerabilities.

## My Philosophy

I believe in the power of code to transform and improve the lives of people around the world. I strive to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code. I'm a firm believer in the open-source movement, and contribute to it as much as I can.

## Get in Touch

Feel free to reach out if you have a question, want to collaborate on a project, or just want to say hi. I'm always open to making new connections in the tech industry.

Happy coding! ðŸ’»
